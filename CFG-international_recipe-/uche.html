    <h1>Hi there: welcome to unspoken rules: Naija Style ;-)</h1>
    <h2>Unspoken Rules - Nigeria!</h2>

   <div>
    <<p>
      In every country there are a set of unwritten and unspoken rules that
      are present...
       In Nigerian culture, there are many unspoken rules but these are usually predicated upon respect for elders and having 'street smarts'...
       It would be wise to follow to have an easier transition into the country and a generally peaceful experience;...
    </p>
    To make it easier, the rules can be categorised into three different sections.
      <ol>
        <li>Respect for elders</li>
>

        <li id= "lower">Being Intentional</li>
        <li id="lowest">The Use of Initiative </li>
      </ol>

      <h2><em>So, what are the unspoken rules?</em></h2>
          <p>
           Let's see!
    <ul>
      <li>     Proper greetings are a MUST when it comes to elders. Simply saying 'Hi' is abominable and WILL tarnish your reputaion <img src="greeting.jpg" width="400px"> <img src="greetingelders.jpg" width="400px"></li>
      <li>There is a cultural stigma about shaking hands and passing items with your left hand. If in doubt, best bets are to use both hands</li>
      <img src="righthandgreeting.jpg" width="400px">
      <li>When in an open-air market; speak 'pigeon' (a local version of english that most non-native speakers can understand); foregn accents will only attract higher prices!</li>
      <li>The market place is not a sight-seeing area. For your own peace, do not go if you have no intention of actually buying anything, you will be berated if you play with the market sellers time.
      <li>When eating a meal, reseve your meat till the end. This is often a test your self-control :-)</li>
      <img src="meat.jpg" width="400px">
      <li>When crossing the road - outside lagos and Abuja cities - run when you have the chance; road signals are not always obeyed dont expect for cars to wait for you. </li>
